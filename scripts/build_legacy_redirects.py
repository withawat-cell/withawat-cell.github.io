"""Generate static redirect stubs for the old Google Sites URL structure.

thz-el.org used to be mapped to a Google Site (sites.google.com/view/thzel),
whose pages live at extension-less paths like /home, /research,
/publications/journal-articles, /people/researchers, etc. GitHub Pages
already serves a clean path like /research directly from research.html with
no redirect (confirmed for every legacy path except one), so a stub is only
needed where no equivalently-named .html file exists at the new site's
root -- which is just the landing page (home.html has no equivalent; the
new site's landing page is index.html).
